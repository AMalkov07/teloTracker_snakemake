# config_label.yaml
# Configuration for Pipeline 2: Reference Labeling
#
# Usage: snakemake -s Snakefile_label -c 56
#
# Prerequisites: Run Snakefile_create_ref first to generate the polished reference

# Required: Base name for the analysis (must match Pipeline 1)
base_name: "dorado_fast5_7575_day0_PromethION_no_tag_yes_rejection"

# Required: Strain identifier (must match Pipeline 1)
strain: "7575"

# Anchor set name
anchor_set: "test_anchors"

# Paths to reference files for labeling
references:
  anchors: "references/test_anchors.fasta"
  # Y prime sequences from RepeatMasker (use strain-specific file)
  repeatmasker_y_primes: "references/repeatmasker_7575_all_y_primes.fasta"
  # X prime sequences for detection (optional)
  xprimes: "references/7575_xprimes.fasta"
  # Y prime probe for verification (optional)
  probe: "references/probe.fasta"

# BLAST parameters for labeling
min_pident: 75.0      # Minimum percent identity (lowered for cross-strain comparison)
min_length: 100       # Minimum alignment length
evalue: "1e-5"        # E-value threshold

# Boundary adjustment parameters (to maximize ITS regions between features)
# Trims telomeric bases from feature boundaries:
#   - R arm: trims T and G from feature ends until hitting A or C
#   - L arm: trims A and C from feature ends until hitting T or G
adjust_boundaries: true
boundary_window: 50   # Minimum feature size to maintain after trimming (bp)
